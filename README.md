# Compass

Compass is a local community resource directory designed to connect people with support groups and services in their area.

## The Idea
Finding reliable information about local playgroups, employment support, and community services can be difficult. Information is often scattered across social media or outdated websites.

Compass aims to solve this by providing a central, easy-to-search directory for local community members. It is designed to host essential details such as:
* Contact details
* Opening times
* Map locations
* Services offered

## Project Status: In Progress
I am currently building the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

### Roadmap
- [ ] **Home Page:** Landing page with a clear mission statement.
- [ ] **Resource List:** A dynamic list showing available community groups.
- [ ] **Search:** Functionality to filter by category (e.g., "Family", "Employment").
- [ ] **Map Integration:** Visualise locations on a map.
